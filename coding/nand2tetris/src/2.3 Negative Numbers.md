## Two's Complement
![[Number Representation#Two's Complement (Standard)]]

To represent $-x$ using the positive number:
$$2^n - x$$

### Addition with 2's Complement
With the multi-bit adder, the result of adding negative numbers are just the same.

Reason:
The addition of two negative numbers throw away the last carry output
- Negative number is represented as $x\mod 2^n$
- Addition is $x \mod 2^n$

### Computing $-x$ in 2's Complement
> Subtraction is done with negator:
> $$y - x = y + (-x)$$

$$\begin{align}-x &= \neg x +1\\
2^n - x &= \big((2^n - 1)-x\big) + 1\end{align}$$
- $2^n - 1$ is always all 1s
	- $11111111_2$
- $11\cdots1 _2 - x = \neg x$
	- $11111111_2 - 10110100 = 01001011$
- Adding one is simple


#### Increment of Input (Adding 1)
- Flip the bits starting at first
- Until hitting 0, flip that bit and stop
