**Combinatorial Logic**
- No sequence or time
- Fixed and unchanging input
- Output is the result of function computed instantaneously

**The Introduction of Time (Sequential Logic)**
- Reuse hardware, changing the input
- Remember State
- Speed

## The Clock
The clock is a periodic waveform in which each interval between pulses (the period) equals the time for one bit.

The time between the beginning of a **tick** and the end of the subsequent **tock** is called a **cycle** (integer time unit)

- Combinatorial Logic
$$out[\,t\,] = function (in[\,t\,])$$
- Sequential Logic
$$out[\,t\,] = function (in[\,t-1\,])$$

```
Time |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
In   |  a  |  b  |  c  |  d  |
Out  |     |f(a) |f(b) |f(c) | 
```

Sequential logic allows for reusing the previous state as input
$$state[\,t\,] = function(state[\,t-1\,])$$
```
Time |   1   |   2   |   3   |   4   |
State|   a   |b=f(a) |c=f(b) |d=f(c) |
```
