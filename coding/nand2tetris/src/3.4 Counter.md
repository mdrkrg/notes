## The Usage of Counter
Counters are used to keep on track of instruction to execute next
- As the program executes, the counter increments, enabling the computer to read instructions one by one.
- Enabling maunally changing the count to change instruction.

The control mechanism can be realized by a **Program Counter**
### Program Counter
A PC contains the address of the instructions that will be fetched and executed next.

Control settings:
- Reset: fetch the first instruction `PC=0`
- Next: fetch the next instruction `PC++`
- Goto: fetch instruction *n* `PC=n`

## The Counter Chip Abstraction

```
if (reset[t] == 1) out[t+1] = 0
else if (load[t] == 1) out[t+1] = in[t]
else if (inc[t] == 1) out[t+1] = out[t] + 1
else out[t+1] = out[t]
```
