## Remembering States
- We want to remember one bit of information from time $t-1$ to be used in $t$
- End of one time bit, there're two states: Remembering 0 or 1

**Flip-Flops** are gates that can flip between these two states
- Data are **internal state** rather than just immediate inputs or outputs
## The Clocked Data Flip Flop (DFF)

- In this course the negated output port $\overline Q$ is not used
$$out[\,t\,] = in[\,t-1\,]$$
### Implementation of DFF
Primitive to this course

In physical implementation, DFFs can be built from actual gates:
1. Create a "loop" achieveing an "un-clocked" flip-flop
2. Isolation accross tims steps using a "master-slave" setup

> [!note]
> A cycle in the hardware connection in `HardwareSimulator` is only allowed **if it passes through a sequential gate**

### Sequential Logic With DFF

## 1-Bit Register
![[1-bit_Register.svg]]
Remember an input bit until requested to load a new value.
```
if load(t-1) 
then out(t) = in(t-1)
else out(t) = out(t-1)
```
### Implementation
The **selection** between whether to output `out(t-1)` or `in(t-1)` behaves exactly as MUX chip
