RAM
- data
- instruction
## Register: Basic Memory Element
![[Register.svg]]

- w (**word width**): 16-bit, 32-bit, ...
- Register's state: the value which is currently stored inside the register
	- Actually it is just keep outputing the value, creating the illusion of "storage"


### Read Logic
To read a Register just probe the output.
### Write Logic
To set value `v` to Register:
1. set `in = v`
2. set `load = 1`

Result:
- The Register's state becomes `v`
- From the **next cycle onward**, `out` emits `v`


## RAM Unit
### RAM Abstraction
![[RAM.svg]]
A RAM unit is a stack of *n* addressable Registers, addressed from 0 to *n-1*.

- At any given point of time, only ONE register in the RAM is selected
- k (width of address input): $k = \log_2n$
- w (word width)
- RAM is a sequential chip, with a clocked behaviour
### RAM Operation
**Read**
To read Register `i`:
1. set `address = i`

Result:
- `out` emits the state of Register `i`

**Writing**
To set Register `i` to `v`:
1. set `load = 1`
2. set `in = v`
3. set `address = i`

Result:
- The state of Register `i` becomes `v`
- From the next cycle onward, `out` emits `v`
