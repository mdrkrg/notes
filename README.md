Info about this Repo
===

## Info
This repo is intended to serve as a Vitepress migration of my Obsidian note base. 
It contains notes that I want to make public, although most of these notes are gathered from online sources.

It is a bit pity that most of my notes are neither original works of effort, nor gatherings of good online content scraps pieced together.
But hopefully this will do a bit help for building your own knowledge base.

About the licence, I currently only have vague ideas about all those difference between, and am not even sure whether I should distribute them under CC0.
Obviously, most of contents are gathered online, so if any of the contents are violating your terms of rights, please contact me via Issue, email, etc.

A bit of notes on markdown extension: The note files are basically hard linked to the original files in my note repo, so I will only try to adapt the syntax of markdown extension that are used in Obsidian, to Vitepress, but not vise versa.
