Calculus I
===
These are course notes for SJTU MATH1201.

I struggled in this course and got B-. This is where all the nightmare starts.

You might notice the format of these notes are pretty ugly. This is because I didn't form a good formatting habit (bad line breaks, ugly TeX formula layout, etc.). I should really consider adding a formatter as dependency...
