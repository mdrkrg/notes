Nand to Tetris
===
This is a course related to Machine structures that teaches you how to build the fundamentals of a computer from a NAND gate.

I include this old piece of notes for links in CS61C.

Most notes are not displayed on this site, but you can find them in the [source code](https://github.com/mdrkrg/mdrkrg.github.io/tree/main/coding/nand2tetris).
