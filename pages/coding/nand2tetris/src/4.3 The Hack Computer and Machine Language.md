## Hardware
Hack is a 16-bit machine
- Data memory (RAM): a sequence of 16-bit reigsters
	- `RAM[0], ...`
- Instruction memory (ROM): a sequence of 16-bit registers
	- `ROM[0], ...`
- Central Processing Unit (CPU): performs 16-bit instructions
- Instruction bus / data bus / address buses


## Software
Hack machine language:
- 16-bit A-instructions
- 16-bit C-instructions

Hack Program: A sequence of instructions written in the machine language


## Control
1. The ROM is loaded with a Hack program
2. The *reset* button is pushed
3. The program starts running


## Registers
There're three types of registers
- In CPU
	- D register: holds a 16-bit value (data)
	- A register: holds a 16-bit value (data or address)
- In RAM
	- M register: represents the 16-bit RAM register addressed by A


## Instructions
### The A-instruction
**Syntax** `@value`

`value` is either
- a non-negative decimal constant
- a symbol refering to such a constant

**Semantics**:
- Sets the A register to `value`
- Side effect: `RAM[A]` becomes the **selected** RAM register

Example:
```Assembly
// Set RAM[100] to -1
@100  // A = 100
M=-1  // RAM[100] = -1
```

### The C-instruction
- computation
- destination
- jump directive

1. First compute
2. Second do two things
	- Either store to destination
	- Or jump to another instruction
```
dest = comp; jump
```

**`comp` pneumonics (operation symbols)**:
```
// comp = 
0, 1, -1, D, A, !D, !A, -D, -A, D+1, A+1, D-1, A-1, 
             M,     !M,     -M,      M+1,      M-1,
D+A, D-A, A-D, D&A, D|A
D+M, D-M, M-D, D&M, D|M
```

**`dest` pneumonics**:
```
// dest=
null, M, D, MD, A, AM, AD, AMD
// Store the result into the(se) registers
```
- `M` refers to `RAM[A]`

**`jump` pneumonics**:
```
// jump=
null, JGT, JEQ, JGE, JLT, JNE, JLE, JMP
       >    ==   >=   <    !=   <=   Unconditioned 
```
- Comparasion alway compare with `0`

**Semantics**:
- Compute the value of `comp`
- Store the result in `dest`
- If the Boolean expression `comp jump 0` is true, jumps to execute the instruction stored in `ROM[A]`


Examples:

```
// unconditional jump to ROM[53]
@53
0; JMP
```
