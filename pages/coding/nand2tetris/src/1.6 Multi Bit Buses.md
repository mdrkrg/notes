## Arrays of Bits
An array of bits can be viewed as a single entity, termed **bus**
### Bus
**Bus selection**
```
/*
 * Computes a bit-wise AND of its two 4-bit
 * input buses
 */
CHIP And4 {
	IN bus[4];
	OUT out[4];
	
	PARTS:
		And (a=a[0], b=b[0], out=out[0]);
		And (a=a[1], b=b[1], out=out[1]);
		And (a=a[2], b=b[2], out=out[2]);
		And (a=a[3], b=b[3], out=out[3]);
}
```

> [!warning]
> Bits in a binary number are indiced **from right to left** in a bus
> - for decimal `2` (binary `10`), `bus[0] = 0` and `bus[1] = 1`

**Sub-buses** `a[0..x]`
```
...
IN lsb[8], msb[8], ...
...
Add16 (a[0..7]=lsb, a[8..15]=msb, b=..., out=...);
Add16 (..., out[0..3]=t1, out[4..15]=t2);
```
- Overlaps of sub-buses are allowed on output
- Width of internal pins is deduced automatically
- `false` and `true` can fill buses of any width
