## Mathematics
The mathematics are as simple as addition of 10-based digits

- Add two binary number of the same bit and the carry (from the last bit)
- If sum exeeds 1, sum turns 0, add 1 to the next **carry**

### Overflow
Overflow occurs when the result of addition exceeds the maximum length of binary digits ($2^N$), resulting the result to be the modulo of $2^N$ (**decreases $2^N$**)

## Digital Adder
- Half Adder - adds two bits
- Full Adder - adds three bits
- Adder - Adds two numbers

### Half Adder

If the **carry is 0**, then

| a   | b   | Sum | Carry |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 1     |
- $Sum = a \text{ XOR } b$
- $Carry = a \text{ AND } b$

### Full Adder

Why a half adder is called **HALF**? There're two of them in a **FULL** Adder.

Take the carry into consideration

| a   | b   | c (last carry) | Sum | Carry |
| --- | --- | -------------- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | 0   | 0              | 0   | 0     |
| 0   | 0   | 1              | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 0              | 1   | 0     |
| 1   | 0   | 1              | 0   | 1     |
| 0   | 1   | 0              | 1   | 0     |
| 0   | 1   | 1              | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 0              | 0   | 1     |
| 1   | 1   | 1              | 1   | 1     |
- There're two ways to get $Sum = 1$
	1. $HalfAdd(a, b)_{sum} = 0$ And $c = 1$
	2. $HalfAdd(a, b)_{sum} = 1$ And $c = 0$
	- Otherwise Sum = 0
	- $$Sum = HalfAdd(HalfAdd(a,b)_{sum}, c)_{sum}$$
- There're two ways to get $Carry = 1$
	1. $HalfAdd(a,b)_{sum} = 1$ And $c=1$
	2. $HalfAdd(a,b)_{carry} = 1$ 
		- ($c$ doesn't matter because $HalfAdd(a,b)_{sum} \equiv 0$, so $c$ only affect $Sum$)
	- $$Carry = HalfAdd(HalfAdd(a,b)_{sum}, c))_{carry} \lor HalfAdd(a,b)_{carry}$$

### Multi-bit Adder
- The first c is always 0
- The last carry is thrown (ignore the overflow)

For N-bit adder
- 1 Half adder
- N-1 Full adder
