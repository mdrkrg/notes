CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
===
Ahh... This is where this all begins.

It was late night at 2024-01-16 (Yes I literally just `stat` my files), when I took the first step into this course, and all my journey of programming begins.

Look back on these notes, I'm surprised to remember most of the contents apart from the code are summarized with my own opinions and reflections over the materials given by Prof. DeNero, which is quite praiseworthy due to the fact that during these days I prefer reading over the text, and just yanking and pasting them all over into my notes.

I rarely approach these notes today. Partly because they're already known, and partly because I'm busy and lazy. There are some new stuff I've rediscovered when I'm filtering through them, like the keyword `nonlocal` and function decorator `@`. I might need to come back to these later on when I get my hands on some backend projects...

I stopped, as the new semester approached, shortly after I finished the project 3 "Scheme". (This is why I always joke about '学期' (semester) to be '学间期' (somewhere in the middle of learning) since I have no control over my learning during these times.) It is a pity that I didn't leave any design info or docs other than the code itself, which could have been a good material to reflect on. I had also done it way too fast, for the fear that I might not be able to finish it. The price is, I didn't remember a single byte from it.

It is fair enough to say, "You've came across so much burdens during the semester, so forgetfulness is just normal", but it did remind me of the importance of **writing design docs and reflections**. (Though you didn't write it again in CS61C Project 1, 2.)

The missing parts are SQLs. Initially I thought it was not a big deal. This didn't strike me until I suddenly become NIMO's WebDev, and need to take care of all of those frontend, backend and stuff. I will come back to them later.

Oh, by the way, in the meantime I took another one called SysAdmin Decal, for learning Linux usage and management, git, apt, and fun. Unfortunately I didn't leave text materials behind. Great course though, I'll recommend all those who want to at least know about Linux to take a look at this course.
