## Q1
```python
def filter(condition, lst):
    """Filters lst with condition using mutation.
    >>> original_list = [5, -1, 2, 0]
    >>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, original_list)
    >>> original_list
    [2, 0]
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    for x in list(lst):
        if not condition(x):
            lst.remove(x)
```
Notice that if we mutate `lst`, the `for` statement would produce unstable result. In this case, if we iterate over `lst`, the below situation happens:
- `__iter__` method is called, creating a iterator
- The pointer of the iterator points to index `0`
- `__next__` method is called, `5` is extracted and bound to `x` in a local frame, pointer points to index `1`
- The first element of `lst` got removed, and now the iterator's element of index `1` is `2`
- Leading error, etc.

So, we need to create a new temperate list by calling `list(lst)`

## Q2
```python
def deep_map_mut(func, lst):
    """Deeply maps a function over a list, replacing each item
    in the original list object.
    Does NOT return the mutated list object.

    >>> l = [1, 2, [3, [4], 5], 6]
    >>> deep_map_mut(lambda x: x * x, l)
    >>> l
    [1, 4, [9, [16], 25], 36]
    >>> # Check that you're not making new lists
    >>> s = [3, [1, [4, [1]]]]
    >>> s1 = s[1]
    >>> s2 = s1[1]
    >>> s3 = s2[1]
    >>> deep_map_mut(lambda x: x + 1, s)
    >>> s
    [4, [2, [5, [2]]]]
    >>> s1 is s[1]
    True
    >>> s2 is s1[1]
    True
    >>> s3 is s2[1]
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    for x in lst:
        if type(x) == list:
            deep_map_mut(func, x)
            continue
        lst[lst.index(x)] = func(x)
```
IDK whether there's any other solution not using `continue`
## Q3
Include the [[Tree ADT]]
```python

    """Return the maximum root-to-leaf path sum of a tree.
    >>> t = tree(1, [tree(5, [tree(1), tree(3)]), tree(10)])
    >>> max_path_sum(t) # 1, 10
    11
    >>> t2 = tree(5, [tree(4, [tree(1), tree(3)]), tree(2, [tree(10), tree(3)])])

    if is_leaf(t):

    return label(t) + max([max_path_sum(branch) for branch in branches(t)])
```
## Q4
```python
def has_path(t, word):
    """Return whether there is a path in a tree where the entries along the path
    spell out a particular word.

    >>> greetings = tree('h', [tree('i'),
