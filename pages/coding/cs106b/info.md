CS106B Programming Abstractions in C++
===
I... Really didn't remember anything from this course. This is like about in the late February 2024 when I first came into this course, and I purely treated it as a substitute for CS1501 here in SJTU.

A lot of things has happened since then. I got lost in exam preparation for math and physics and stuff, chasing for Grade Points. (If you wonder why, you can check out [[/pages/math/calculus1/info|here]].) And got desperate by me getting the one and only programming course, envying those getting better education. These programming stuff got really abandoned but kept harassing me, as I constantly being upset by not being able to keep my hands dirty.

Things got much better during the summer holidays, though I don't have much time.

Back to the topic. It did taught me some principles and fundamentals in C++, as well as a recap of programming abstractions which I learnt in CS61A.

I didn't finished the course. Later on it has some data structure and algorithm stuff, which is not quite related to CS1501. Still, it is some good material, I put it here for some sort of reference and nostalgia.
