Dev Notes
===

During the construction of this site, I've found some of the official markdown extensions community plugins I use back in Obsidian are not supported here in markdown-it or Vitepress. So I decided to build the wheel myself, and then I decided to do some writings to note down the things I've learnt and reflect upon the process.

It will be a good place for noting down various things during projects and anything.
